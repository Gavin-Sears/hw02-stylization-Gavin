# HW 2: *3D Stylization*

## Inspiration

"The Scream" by Edvard Munch

I also was interested in a horror aesthetic like Tales from the crypt:

Created Sky effect using depth texture as mask, with drawn lines distorted by noise.

All shader effects contained within Three-tone smooth toon shader (has ability to render shadow textures also), Vignette (includes party vignette), and fullscreen_FX (sky animation, outlines, invert colors).

## Overview of Controls:
- R - Revert to regular mode
- P - Toggle Party mode (animated confetti vignette, inverted colors, color shifting outlines, moving character)
- M - "Memory" mode (sepia with a vignette)
